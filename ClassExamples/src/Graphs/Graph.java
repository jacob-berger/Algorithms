public class Graph {
	/*
	 * Graph G = (V, E): a set of vertices V and a set of edges E; each edge in E is a connection between a pair of vertices in V, which are called adjacent vertices.
	 * 	-undirected graph
	 * 		Each vertex in the graph can be traversed in either direction through the edge
	 * 	-directed graph
	 * 		Each vertex can only be traversed in one direction through the edge
	 * 	-weighted graph
	 * 		Each edge has a numeric cost associated with it
	 * 	-sparse graph
	 * 		has few edges relative to the number of vertices
	 * 	-dense graph
	 * 		has many edges relative to the number of vertices
	 * 	-complete graph
	 * 		has all possible edges and can be directed or undirected
	 * 
	 * A path is simple if all vertices on the path are distinct
